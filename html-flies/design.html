        <p>
          My innovative healthcare device, MediBot is a user-friendly diagnostic
          device with a touch screen interface for easy symptom input via
          images. Additionally, it incorporates a temperature sensor to monitor
          patients' body temperature. Powered by artificial intelligence, it
          analyzes symptoms to predict potential diseases. Integrated with the
          hospital's electronic health record system, it provides real-time
          diagnostic information to healthcare professionals. This all-in-one
          device enhances efficiency, accuracy, and patient care by combining
          advanced diagnostic capabilities with vital signs monitoring.

            The interface will be programmed with the Tkinker Python library. The
            first page will be a welcome page that tells the patient a little
            about the device. A start button will be programmed for the patient to
            click and move to the next page. On the next page, there will be a
            form that will ask for the patient’s name, age, and hospital
            (optional). There will be a next button at the bottom of the form,
            which, when clicked, will take the patient to the next page, where he
            will select the symptoms. Under each image, there will be a yes and a
            no button for the selection. On the next page, a congratulatory
            message will be displayed to the patient.Two buttons will be under the
            message asking the user whether he wants to send the prediction to the
            health provider or print it as a hard copy.

            The Raspberry Pi 5 will be the system of the device. The Python code
            will be written unto it for the process of the date from the user. The
            patient’s details from the form will be stored in an object(a data
            type of data in programming). Each image of a symptom will be linked
            to its name in the backend code. It will be programmed in such a way
            that when the patient selects “Yes” the name will be added to the
            object in the form of a list. The backend code will use the patient’s
            hospital ID to retrieve the patient’s past health record from the
            hospital’s Electronic health system if it has one. The data from the
            object and the electron health record will be sent to the AI through
            an API request and get a prediction as a response. A code will be
            written to send the prediction to the health provider’s computer or
            can be printed as a hard copy.

            THe Chat GPT 3.5 turbo model will be trained on a dataset of about a
            billion or half a billion symptoms and their corresponding disease or
            illness. The dataset will come from a trusted source like Kaggle and
            WHO. Also, the AI will learn from its past users so that it will be
            able to make accurate and precise predictions.Insight wil be taken
            from professional doctors to enchace the operation of the AI.
