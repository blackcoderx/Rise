          <h2 class="question">Delayed Diagnosis </h2>

          <div class="content">
            <p>
              Delayed diagnosis occurs when a health problem is not recognized or identified as soon as it should be. 
              This can be due to a variety of factors, such as errors in medical judgment, misinterpretation of test results,
              or lack of communication between healthcare providers. 
              According to an article from CNN Health,
              As a result, about 371,000 people die and 424,000 sustain permanent disabilities, such as brain damage, 
              blindness, loss of limbs or organs, or metastasized cancer, each year.
              To make the estimate, researchers pulled from dozens of earlier studies to assess how often certain
              conditions were missed and how often that miss led to serious harm. That risk was then scaled by the 
              incidence rate of new cases in the total US population.

              My innovative healthcare device, MediBot is a user-friendly diagnostic
              device with a touch screen interface for easy symptom input via
              images. Additionally, it incorporates a temperature sensor to monitor
              patients' body temperature. Powered by artificial intelligence, it
              analyzes symptoms to predict potential diseases. Integrated with the
              hospital's electronic health record system, it provides real-time
              diagnostic information to healthcare professionals. This all-in-one
              device enhances efficiency, accuracy, and patient care by combining
              advanced diagnostic capabilities with vital signs monitoring.

              Input Stage: <br>
              The patient will enter his name, age, and hospital ID if he is a member of the hospital. 
              The ID will help the backend system connect the electronic health record in the prediction process.
              After entering the necessary credentials, he will describe how he feels using text or images on the device.
              The images will be illustrations depicting various known symptoms. If he doesn't see an illustration that matches how he feels in the carousel of images, he can enter text instead.
