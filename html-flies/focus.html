      <div class="explanation">
        <p>
          Delayed diagnosis occurs when a health problem is not recognized or
          identified as soon as it should be. This can be due to a variety of
          factors, such as misdiagnosis, misinterpretation of test results, or
          lack of communication between healthcare providers. According to an
          article from CNN Health, As a result, about 371,000 people die and
          424,000 sustain permanent disabilities, such as brain damage,
          blindness, loss of limbs or organs, or metastasized cancer, each year.
          To make the estimate, researchers pulled from dozens of earlier
          studies to assess how often certain conditions were missed and how
          often that miss led to serious harm. That risk was then scaled by the
          incidence rate of new cases in the total US population.

        <h2>Causes Of Delayed Diagnosis</h2>
        <ul class="causes-list">
          <li>
            <p>
              Failure to recognize symptoms: <br />
              Healthcare providers may fail to recognize the signs and symptoms
              of a condition, leading to delayed diagnosis.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Communication breakdown: <br />
              Lack of communication between healthcare providers or between
              providers and patients can lead to delayed diagnoses. Some
              patients are illiterate, therefore they are not able to tell the
              healthcare providers their symptoms properly. This makes the
              language barrier another problem.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Systemic issues: <br />
              Problems with the healthcare system, such as long wait times for
              appointments or understaffed facilities, can contribute to delayed
              diagnosis.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              Misinterpretation of Information: <br />
              In healthcare, accurate and clear communication is crucial for
              understanding patient symptoms, medical histories, and test
              results. Misinterpretation of information, either between
              healthcare providers or between providers and patients, can lead
              to delayed diagnosis.

        <h2>Effects of Delayed Diagnosis</h2>
        <ul class="effects-list">
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Progression of the Disease:</span> <br />
              If a health issue isn't detected and treated early, it can
              continue to get worse. Some conditions, like certain cancers, may
              become more advanced and harder to treat if not caught in the
              early stages.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Complications:</span> <br />
              Delayed diagnosis can lead to complications. For example, a simple
              infection might turn into a more severe illness if not addressed
              promptly.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Reduced Treatment Success:</span> <br />Some conditions respond better to
              treatment when identified early. Delayed diagnosis may mean that
              treatment is less effective or requires more aggressive measures.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Psychological Impact:</span> <br />
              Living with an undiagnosed health issue can be emotionally
              challenging. It can cause stress, anxiety, and uncertainty for the
              person and their family.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Financial Impact:</span> <br> As the condition progresses, the cost
              of treatment may increase. Delayed diagnosis may result in more
              extensive medical interventions, longer hospital stays, and higher
              medical expenses.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Quality of Life:</span> <br> Depending on the nature of the health
              problem, delayed diagnosis can affect a person's overall quality
              of life. Chronic conditions, when not managed early, may lead to
              long-term symptoms that impact daily activities.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <span>Spread of Communicable Diseases: </span> <br> In cases of infectious
              diseases, delayed diagnosis can contribute to the spread of the
              illness to others, especially if the person is unaware of their
              condition.
