          The patient will enter his name, age, and hospital ID if he is a
          member of the hospital. The ID will help the backend system connect
          the electronic health record in the prediction process. After entering
          the necessary credentials, he will describe how he feels using text or
          images on the device. The images will be illustrations depicting
          various known symptoms. If he doesn't see an illustration that matches
          how he feels in the carousel of images, he can enter text instead.

          <span>Processing Stage: </span> <br />The device transmits
          comprehensive patient records, including vital details like name, age,
          and hospital ID, which are linked to electronic health records. The AI
          backend uses this data to predict potential illnesses or diseases. The
          algorithm, designed and continuously learning, analyzes the data to
          generate insightful predictions. The AI's ability to recognize
          patterns, correlate symptoms, and draw from a vast knowledge base
          enables healthcare professionals to make informed decisions.

          After the AI generates insights from predictive analysis, providing a
          comprehensive overview of potential diseases based on a patient's
          symptoms. These insights are then transmitted to the nurse, enabling
          targeted checks and assessments. For example, hypertension can be
          identified as a concern, allowing for additional diagnostic tests and
          physical examinations. The AI also acts as a supportive partner,
          providing contextual information and guiding decision-making. This
          collaborative approach ensures informed and timely care, resulting in
          a more precise, efficient, and personalized approach to patient care.
